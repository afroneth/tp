The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At App launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#26-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

1. [**`UI`**](#22-ui-component): The UI of the App.
2. [**`Logic`**](#23-logic-component): The command executor.
3. [**`Model`**](#24-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
4. [**`Storage`**](#25-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

</p>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<p align="center">

    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 3. Execution diagram for "delete 1" command</em>
</p>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2 UI component

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 4. Structure of the UI Component</em>
</p>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 2.3 Logic component

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 5. Structure of the Logic Component</em>
</p>

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

`Logic` uses the `CliniCalParser` class to parse the user command.
This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient).
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

<p align="center">

</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 2.4 Model component

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png"/>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 7. Structure of the Model Component</em>
</p>

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the CliniCal application data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div align="center" markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has an `Allergy` list in the `CliniCal` application, which `Patient` references. This allows `CliniCal` to only require one `Allergy` object per unique `Allergy`, instead of each `Patient` needing their own `Allergy` object.
    <img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 8. Alternative structure for Model component</em>
</div>


### 2.5 Storage component

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 9. Structure of the Storage Component </em>
</p>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the patient data in json format and read it back.

### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 Undo/Redo feature

#### 3.1.1 Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCliniCal`. It extends `CliniCal` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `CliniCalStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCliniCal#commit()` — Saves the current CliniCal application state in its history.
* `VersionedCliniCal#undo()` — Restores the previous CliniCal application state from its history.
* `VersionedCliniCal#redo()` — Restores a previously undone CliniCal application state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCliniCal()`, `Model#undoCliniCal()` and `Model#redoCliniCal()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCliniCal` will be initialized with the initial CliniCal application state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single CliniCal application state.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoRedoState0.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 10. Initial CliniCalStateList</em>
</p>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the patient data list. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCliniCal()`, causing the modified state of the CliniCal application after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `CliniCalStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted CliniCal application state.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoRedoState1.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 11. CliniCalStateList after "delete 5" command</em>
</p>

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCliniCal()`, causing another modified CliniCal application state to be saved into the `CliniCalStateList`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoRedoState2.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 12. CliniCalStateList after "add n/David" command</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCliniCal()`, so the CliniCal application state will not be saved into the `CliniCalStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCliniCal()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous CliniCal application state, and restores the CliniCal application to that state.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoRedoState3.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 13. CliniCalStateList after undo command</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial CliniCal state, then there are no previous CliniCal states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCliniCal()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 14. Logic and Model Component Interactions for Undo Command</em>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoCliniCal()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the CliniCal application to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `CliniCalStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest CliniCal application state, then there are no undone CliniCal states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCliniCal()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the CliniCal application, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCliniCal()`, `Model#undoCliniCal()` or `Model#redoCliniCal()`. Thus, the `CliniCalStateList` remains unchanged.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UndoRedoState4.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 15. CliniCalStateList after list command</em>
</p>

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCliniCal()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `CliniCalStateList`, all CliniCal application states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

    <img src="images/UndoRedoState5.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 16. CliniCalStateList after clear command</em>

</p>

#### 3.1.2 Design consideration

##### 3.1.2.1 Aspect: Execution of undo/redo

* **Current Implementation:** Saves the entire patient details in CliniCal application.

  * Pros:
       * It is easier to implement as the entire list of patients would be saved. The list of patients can then be 
  easily loaded to be used or saved for future use by `Model`.
  
  * Cons:
       * This may have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative Implementation:** Undo/redo function is handled by each individual command.

  * Pros:
       * The application will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
  
  * Cons:
       * The implementation of undo/redo for each specific command must be correct.
  
##### 3.1.2.2 Aspect: Choice of data structure to store CliniCal application states
  
 * **Current Implementation:** List with `currentStatePointer` pointing to the current CliniCal state.
  
    * Pros:
         * It is easier to implement as only a single List is required and all states can be accessed.
    
    * Cons:
         * This requires constant updating of the `CliniCalStateList` such as purging of redundant states.
  
 * **Alternative Implementation:** Two Stacks - CommandsExecutedStack and RedoStack
  
    * Pros:
         * The more intuitive solution as a stack follows the Last In First Out principle. There would be no need for 
    any `currentStatePointer` since the current state would be at the top of the stacks.
    
    * Cons:
         * Harder to implement as two separate stacks would have to be tracked and there would be more dependencies to 
    implement before and after the execution of every command.

### 3.2 Add Profile Picture feature

#### 3.2.1 Implementation

This feature allows users to add image files to serve as the patient's profile picture. The mechanism utilises the `StorageManager#addPictureToProfile`
method to update the patients' profile pictures.

This feature comprises the `AddProfilePictureCommand` class. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/AddProfilePictureSequenceDiagram.png" width="2000" height="550"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 18. Logic Component Interactions for AddProfilePicture Command</em>
</p>

Step 1. User input is parsed to obtain the patient index and file path of the desired profile picture.

Step 2. After successful parsing of user input, the `AddProfilePictureCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called. 

Step 3. The `StorageManager#addPictureToProfile` method is then called which adds the desired profile picture to the specified patient.

Step 4. Next, the patient's profile picture is updated in the `Model` by calling the `Model#setPatient` method.

Step 5. As a result of the successful update of the patient's profile picture, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### 3.2.2 Design consideration

##### 3.2.2.1 Aspect: Choice of component to save the profile pictures

* **Current Implementation:** Save image file through `StorageManager`.

    * Pros:
         * Mechanism can be extended from the existing architecture that the project is built upon (AB3).

    * Cons:
        * There is a need to implement additional exception handling mechanism to inform the user in cases where invalid file path is provided.

* **Alternative Implementation:** Save image files through a new standalone class eg. `ImageCommand`. This class handles all mechanism related to profile pictures.

    * Pros:
        * Exception handling is simplified as informing the user of invalid file path will be similar to when an invalid command is given.

    * Cons:
        * It is harder to store and update patient's profile pictures. 
        * New dependencies need to be created to associate with the newly created `ImageCommand` class.
        * Thus, our team decided to implement the first alternative as it follows the existing architecture closely and minimizes the risk of breaking the existing architecture.

##### 3.2.2.2 Aspect: Image type

* **Current Implementation:** All types of files are accepted, including `.jpg` and `.png`.

    * Pros:
        * User do not need to convert `.jpg` to `.png` file or vice versa before setting desired image file as profile picture.
        * This enhances usability.
    
    * Cons: 
        * Non-image files are still stored in 'data' folder even though the patient's profile picture in CliniCal will not be updated visually.

* **Alternative Implementation:** Accept only some types of files i.e `.jpg` and `.png`.

    * Pros: 
        * Acts as a form of validation check and non-image files will not be stored in the 'data' folder. This helps to save disk space.

    * Cons: 
        * User is only limited to certain types of image files. 
        * As such, our team decided to implement the first alternative as this design maximizes application usability. 
        * User will not need to spend additional time converting their images into accepted file types. 
        * Furthermore, our team assessed that users can easily delete non-image files from the 'data' folder if the need arises.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### 3.3 View Command History feature

#### 3.3.1 Implementation
This feature allows users to view history of recently used commands. 

All entered user inputs (including those in format format or fails to execute) will be stored into a Stack data structure named `commandHistory` 
due to its Last In First Out (LIFO) property which allows the most recently used command to display first.

The mechanism utilises the `CommandHistory#getCommandHistory()` to retrieve a list of past used commands from `commandHistory`.

This feature comprises the `HistoryCommand` and `CommandHistory` classes. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/HistorySequenceDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 19. Logic Component Interactions for History Command</em>
</p>

Step 1. User inputs "history" to execute the history command.

Step 2. After successful parsing of user input, the `HistoryCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

Step 3. The `CommandHistory#getCommandHistory()` is then called which will return a list of past used commands arranged in the ascending order of time last used.

Step 4. As a result of successful retrieval of the command history, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### 3.3.2 Design Considerations

##### 3.3.2.1 Aspect: Choice of data structure to store commands
* **Current Implementation:** Use of stack ADT

   * Pros:
       * Most recently used command will show up at the top of the list. Also known as Last In First Out (LIFO) method.
   * Cons:
       * Data stored in stack is not persistent.

##### 3.3.2.2 Aspect: How commands are stored
* **Current Implementation:** Store all entered commands

   * Pros: 
       * It is easy to implement.
       * The user can check what went wrong with the previous command.
       
   * Cons:
       * The application will need more memory to store both valid and invalid commands.
       
* **Alternative Implementation:** Store only commands that are successfully executed

   * Pros: 
       * User do not need to view invalid commands.
       
   * Cons:
       * User cannot check what went wrong with the previous command.
       
### 3.4 Clear Command History feature

#### 3.4.1 Implementation
This feature allows users to clear history of recently used commands. 

The mechanism utilises the `CommandHistory#clearHistory` to clear all stored commands from `commandHistory`.

This feature comprises the `ClearHistoryCommand` and `CommandHistory` classes. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ClearHistorySequenceDiagram.png"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 20. Logic Component Interactions for ClearHistory Command</em>
</p>

Step 1. User inputs "clearhistory" to execute the clear history command.

Step 2. After successful parsing of user input, the `ClearHistoryCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

Step 3. The `CommandHistory#clearHistory` is then called which will clear all commands stored in `commandHistory`.

#### 3.4.2 Design Considerations
##### 3.4.2.1 Aspect: Choice of Data Structure to clear commands
* **Current Implementation:** Use of stack ADT

    * Pros: 
        * Easy to implement clear function.
        
    * Cons:
        * Command history is not persistent so recently used commands is only kept during the same usage.

### 3.5 Peek Commands With Arrow Keys feature

#### 3.5.1 Implementation
This feature allows users to navigate and reuse past commands using up and down arrow keys.

The mechanism utilises the `CommandHistory#peekNext()` and `CommandHistory#peekPrev()`. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the up/down arrow key mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `CommandHistory` will be initialised with the initial state, and the currentStatePointer pointing to that single state.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UpDownArrowKeyState0.png" width="350"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 21. Initial CommandHistory</em>
</p>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the patient data list. 
The Logic Manager calls `CommandHistory#addUsedCommand()` to add a new command to the stack named `commandHistory`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UpDownArrowKeyState1.png" width="350"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 22. CommandHistory after "delete 5" command</em>
</p>

Step 3. The user now decides to reuse `delete 5` in the command history and press the up arrow key (↑). 
The actionListener of the TextField will detect the up arrow key being pressed and calls `CommandHistory#peekNext()`.
This will shift the currentStatePointer to the right, pointing to the `delete 5` command and returns it.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UpDownArrowKeyState2.png" width="350"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 23. CommandHistory after pressing up arrow</em>
</p>

Step 4. The user now decides not to reuse `delete 5` and go back to the previous command before `delete 5`, i.e. empty. 
The user will now press the down arrow key (↓) and the actionListener of the TextField will detect the down arrow key being pressed and calls `CommandHistory#peekPrev()`.
This will shift the currentStatePointer to the left, pointing to the initial state that is empty and returns it.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/UpDownArrowKeyState3.png" width="350"/>
    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 24. CommandHistory after pressing down arrow</em>
</p>

The following sequence diagram shows how the up down arrow key mechanism works:

    <br>
    <em style="color:#CC5500">Figure 25. Ui Component Interactions for Peeking Commands</em>
</p>


#### 3.5.2 Design Considerations
##### 3.5.2.1 Aspect: How commands are stored
* **Current Implementation:** Peek through all entered commands (including those in wrong format or fails to execute)
    * Pros:
        * Users can edit invalid commands.
        * Users can reuse the same command without typing it all out again.
    * Cons:
        * Only works if the past commands are previously used during the same usage session.
 * **Alternative Implementation:** Peek through commands that can be successfully executed
    * Pros:
        * All past commands reused are valid and can be reused safely.
        * Users require less time to peek through all commands stored in commandHistory as it does not include invalid commands.
    * Cons:
        * Users cannot edit invalid commands and will need to spend more time to retype the valid command.
